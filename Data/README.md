# Experimental Data Description

This folder contains all the data collected from our experiments. The `.pkl` files store all relevant information obtained after execution. From these files, you can extract all runtime and result details.

For files that are too large, we have compressed them before uploading. Please download and extract them to access all the data required for reproducing the experiments.

## File Format

- `.pkl`: Serialized data containing execution details.
- `.zip` / `.tar.gz`: Compressed files containing large `.pkl` datasets.

## Instructions

1. Download the required files.
2. If the file is compressed, unzip it first.
3. Load `.pkl` files using Python (e.g., with `pickle` or `pandas` depending on the content).
4. Refer to our paper/code for how to parse and use the data.

If you have any issues accessing or interpreting the data, please feel free to contact us.
